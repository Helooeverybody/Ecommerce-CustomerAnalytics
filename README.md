# Ecommerce-CustomerAnalytics

Customer growth and retentions has been central challenges for data-driven organization seeking to optimize 
marketing efficiently and long-term profitability, regardless of being in the era of unprecedented AI advancements. 
The project proposes an integrated analytic pipeline combining Customer Segmentation, Predictive CLV, Churn Prediction 
and Experiment based on Policy assumptions to generate actionable insights and personalized interventions. First, 
segmentation techniques are applied to identify the heterogeneous customer groups based on customer behaviors, 
thus predictive CLV models estimate the future contribution of each customer from each group. Churn prediction 
module is then utilized to detect at-risk users, finally, in decision making, Monte Carlo experiment quantify 
the incremental impact of assumption-based policy simulation, allowing the design of targeted strategies that 
maximize conversion and retention lift. Together, this end-to-end pipeline provide robust framework for the 
problem of customer growth.
